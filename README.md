# larsen-c-bathymetry
Mapping the bathymetry underneath Larsen C Ice Shelf.
To do this, you will perform Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to perform gravity inversions.
Start by downloading all of the .py files, you will need these to run the code. Also download "larsen c full inversion.ipynb," as this includes instructions for running the inversion.
You will also need the conda package for python if you do not already have it downloaded.
